## 📱 Mobile Testing Requirements

### Required Devices for Agent 2
- iPhone 12/13/14 (Safari)
- Samsung Galaxy S21/S22 (Chrome)
- iPad Air (Safari)
- Budget Android phone (Chrome)
- Physical device testing mandatory

### Mobile Performance Targets
- Lighthouse Score: > 95
- Touch Response Time: < 100ms
- Camera Activation: < 2s
- Barcode Scan: < 1s
- Offline Sync: < 5s

## 🔗 4-Agent Communication System

### Event Bus (Real-time Messages)
```typescript
import { eventBus } from '@/shared/events/event-bus';

// Broadcast to all agents
eventBus.broadcast('inventory:updated', { productId: '123', quantity: 50 });

// Point-to-point communication
eventBus.send('agent2', { type: 'camera:request', data: 'scan' });

// Subscribe to events
eventBus.on('scan:complete', (data) => {
  console.log('Barcode scanned:', data.barcode);
});
```

### Shared State (Coordination)
```typescript
// All agents can read/write to shared state
// Located at: coordination/shared-state.json
```

### Mock Interfaces (Parallel Development)
```typescript
import { Agent1Mock, Agent2Mock, Agent3Mock, Agent4Mock } from '@/shared/mocks/agent-mocks';

// Use mocks during development
const mockAuth = Agent1Mock.auth;
const mockCamera = Agent2Mock.camera;
```

## 🔒 Conflict Resolution

### Priority Hierarchy
1. **Agent 1** (Foundation) - Highest priority
2. **Agent 3** (Features) - Second priority
3. **Agent 2** (Interface) - Third priority
4. **Agent 4** (Quality) - Adapts to others

### Integration Rules
1. **Never break interfaces** - Changes must be backward compatible
2. **Mocks first** - Update mocks before real implementation
3. **Test before integrate** - All tests must pass before merge
4. **Document changes** - Update shared state after changes
5. **Communicate blocks** - Immediately flag blockers

## 📊 Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Daily Metrics Collection
```bash
# Metrics are automatically collected daily
# Check coordination/metrics/ for historical data
```
